# DBank (A Web3 website)
A front-end website which stores an amount and allow you to perform functions like increasing or decreasing the value with an hourly interest rate (1%) just like [compound](https://compound.finance/) which does the same thing on a large scale.


  This whole website is build on ICP (Internet Computer) which is a blockchain network like ethereum developed by [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/).


  ## Feature
  
  The amount or value if updated will be  persisted even if you refresh your site  or close it. As long as the server is running the value will be persisted like all the changes you made is stored somewhere and cannot be resetted to the default value. For a normal website you need to store it either in local storage or a database.
